# Resolver Terraform Provider

This Terraform provider provides a resource that provides a resolution between keys and values when a subset is unknown to prevent unnessary plan diffs that are no-ops at apply.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.20

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up to date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Using the provider

```terraform
resource "resolver_map" "main" {
  keys        = ["a", "b", "c"]
  result_keys = ["a", "c"]
  values      = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
}

resource "something_else" "main" {
  for_each = resolver_map.main.result

  name       = each.key
  ip_address = each.value
}
```

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `go generate`.

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```
